    Abstract
    This paper explores the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare outcomes.
    
    Introduction
    Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative technology in healthcare.
    
    Methods
    We conducted a systematic review of 50 studies published between 2018 and 2023.
    
    Results
    Our analysis shows that AI-based diagnostic systems achieved an average accuracy of 92%.
    
    Discussion
    The findings suggest that AI can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.
    
    Conclusion
    AI technologies show promise for enhancing healthcare delivery, but further research is needed.`
